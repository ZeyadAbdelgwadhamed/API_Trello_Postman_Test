# API_Trello_Postman_Test
Project Description: Trello API Testing Project using Postman

Welcome to my Trell API testing project built with Postman! üöÄ This project focuses on testing the Trell API, allowing you to interact with Trello features programmatically and validate its behavior.

üåê Project Overview:

The project utilizes Postman, a powerful API testing tool, to send requests to the Trello API, receive responses, and perform comprehensive testing.
It enables you to automate API interactions, validate responses, and ensure the functionality and reliability of the Trello API.
‚öôÔ∏è Key Features and Components:

Trello API Testing: The project leverages Postman's capabilities to interact with the Trello API using various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It covers a wide range of API endpoints and operations.
Token-Based Authentication: To access certain Trello API endpoints, the project implements token-based authentication. It includes mechanisms to generate and manage authentication tokens required for making authenticated requests to the Trello API.
Environment Variables: The project utilizes Postman's environment feature to store and manage environment variables. This allows for easy configuration of Trello API endpoints, authentication credentials, and other dynamic values across different environments (e.g., development, production).
Collection: The project organizes test cases into collections, representing specific Trello API features or modules. Each collection contains a set of API requests and tests related to a particular functionality.
Test Cases: The collection includes a comprehensive set of test cases, covering various scenarios and edge cases. These test cases verify the response correctness, validate the expected status codes, and perform assertions on specific data fields or properties returned by the Trello API.
üîß Usage:
To use this Trello API testing project:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Postman: Download and install the latest version of Postman from the official website (https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Import Collection: Import the provided collection file into Postman. Open Postman, click on the "Import" button, and select the collection file (.json format) provided with the project.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Environment Variables: Configure the required environment variables in Postman, such as the Trello API endpoint URL, authentication token, and other necessary values.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Obtain Token: If token-based authentication is required, obtain aTrello personal access token. Update the environment variable with the generated token.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Execute Test Cases: Run the collection or individual test cases to perform API testing. Postman will send requests to the Trello API, validate responses, and report the results. The test runner in Postman will display the passed and failed assertions.

üí° With this Trello API testing project, you can easily automate and validate Trello API interactions, ensuring the correctness and reliability of your API integrations with Trello. Feel free to explore the provided test cases, customize the collection, and adapt it to your specific testing needs.
